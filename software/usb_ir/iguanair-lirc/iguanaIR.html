<P>
  This driver supports both receiving and sending (blasting) using
  the IguanaIR devices from
  <a href="http://iguanaworks.net/ir">http://iguanaworks.net/ir.</a></p>
<p>
  The LIRC driver works on top of the IguanaIR low-level userspace
  driver which provides a socket interface. It is available from
  the same source, and also packaged for many distributions
  including Debian, Fedora and Arch Linux.
<p>
  The --device argument to the driver is a socket designator created
  by the low-level driveri. It defaults to '0' which implies
  <em>/run/iguanair/0</em>.
<p>
  The kernel has built-in support for these devices in the
  iguanair module. This can be used instead of this driver in
  many cases. If the userspace driver should be used, the
  kernel driver must be blacklisted.</p>
