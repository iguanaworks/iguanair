IguanaIR LIRC driver README
===========================

This driver used to be part of the LIRC sources. In order to improve
the maintenance it has been moved to Iguanaworks, Inc which is the
primary hardware and software vendor.

From 0.9.4 the driver is available at: https://github.com/iguanaworks/iguanair-lirc

As a transition step the same files are available here during the 0.9.4
cycle. These files are a complete lirc driver for iguanair. Building requires
lirc >= 0.9.4. If you are using a packaged version you probably need to
have the -devel and -doc packages installed. Note that the downstream
sources at https://github.com/iguanaworks/iguanair-lirc  are preferred and
will be the only option in next release.

To build and install the driver together with the support files:

    $ make
    $ sudo make install

Verifying the driver after make install:

     $ lirc-lsplugins -q iguanair
     iguanair            -as-  /usr/lib64/lirc/plugins/iguanair.so

Finishing the docs installation is typically done as root:

     $ cd $(pkg-config --variable=plugindocs lirc-driver); sudo make

This completes some files under /var/lib/lirc which are included
in the main manual docs which can be viewed off-line. The path varies, but
in a packaged version typically /usr/share/doc/lirc/lirc.org/html/index.html.
